# tilde slash foo slash bar

# In /Users/bill/sonnets, what is the home directory? What is the username? Which directory is deepest in the hierarchy?

# /Users/bill is the home directory, username is bill, deepest directory is sonnets

# For a user with username bill, how do /Users/bill/sonnets and ~/sonnets differ (if at all)?

#/Users/bill/sonnets is an absolute path and the other uses shorthand, but they both point to the same place
